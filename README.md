# Active Networks as Computer Architecture

This project was done as the final course project for the course "Computer Architecture" where I learnt about and axplored different architectures and their working along with parallel computing for faster and efficient computational methods. 

This paper explores active networks and different ways how we can use them as a computer architecture for better and effcient computational models.

Active networks enable their end users to insert tailor made or customized programs into the nodes included in the network.

In this paper we have explored the 'Capsule' concept - where we try to replace traditional packets in a passive networks with “capsules” - segments of programs that get executed or implemented at each network node/router that they switch or travel/traverse.

Active architectures allow a massive increase in the the complexity of the computation that is allowed internally in the network. These computations can enable modern and different applications, specially those based on information fusion, and other services that leverage networking based storage and computational power.

In this paper I have described our vision of an active network architecture that can be programmed by its users. I expect that active networks will enable a range of new applications in addition to the lead applications that already rely on the interposition of customized computation within the network. However, I believe that this work will also have broader implications, on how we think about networks and their protocols, and on the infrastructure innovation process.
